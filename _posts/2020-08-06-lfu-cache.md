## Description

Design and implement a data structure for Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache

`get(key)` Get the value of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1

`put(key, value)` Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should delete the least frequently used item before inserting a new item. When there is a tie, delete the least recently used item!

Note that the number of times an item is used is the number of calls to the get and put functions for that item since it was inserted (e.g. the "frequency"). This number is set to zero when the item is removed.

```python
lfu = LFUCache(2) # Capacity is 2

lfu.get(key) # Return value if exists, else return -1

lfu.put(key, value) # Create or update the value. Delete item to make room when needed!

lfu.put(1, 1)    # 1 used once
lfu.put(2, 2)    # 1 used once,  2 used once
lfu.get(1)       # 1 used twice, 2 used once (returns 1)
lfu.put(3, 3)    # 1 used twice, 3 used once (2 is removed!)
lfu.get(2)       # Returns -1 since 2 is gone!
```

## Solution

```python
class LFUCache:

  def __init__(self, capacity):
    pass      

  def get(self, key):
    pass

  def put(self, key, value):
    pass
```
